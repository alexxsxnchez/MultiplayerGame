# MultiplayerGame
Working on an HTML5 Multiplayer Game using Phaser for the client rendering, but using a custom physics engine as shared code for both the client and the server.

Will eventually use client prediction and entity interpolation which is why the physics engine is shared code.

----
run `npm run build` to run browserify to build `bundle.js`

run `npm start` to start the server
